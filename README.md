## Installation 

### Download the repository
Before proceeding to  LAiSER, you'd want to follow the steps below to install the required dependencies:
- Clone the repository using 
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Micah-Sanders/LAiSER.git
  ```
  or download the [zip(link)](https://github.com/Micah-Sanders/LAiSER/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file and extract it.

### Install the dependencies
> [!NOTE]
> If you intend to use the Jupyter Notebook interface, you can skip this step as the dependencies will be installed seperately in the Google Colab environment.

Install the required dependencies using the command below:
  ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**NOTE**: Python 3.9 or later, *preferably 3.12*, is expected to be installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


## Setup and Usage
As of now LAiSER can be used a command line tool or from the Jupyter notebook(Google Colab). The steps to setup the tool are as follows:

### Google Colab Setup(preferred)
LAiSER's Jupyter notebook is, currently, the fastest way to get started with the tool. You can access the notebook [here](/notebooks/Extract%20Function%20Colab%20Execution.ipynb)

- Once the notebook is imported in google colaboratory, connect to a GPU-accelerated runtime(T4 GPU) and run the cells in the notebook.

### Command Line Setup
To use LAiSER as a command line tool, follow the steps below:

- Navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the command below:
  ```shell
